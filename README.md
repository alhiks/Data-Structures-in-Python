Introduction

This project demonstrates the implementation of Stack and Queue data structures using an array (Python list). It includes basic operations such as push, pop, enqueue, and dequeue.

Features

Stack Operations:

push(value): Insert an element at the top

pop(): Remove an element from the top

peek(): View the top element without removing it

is_empty(): Check if the stack is empty

Queue Operations:

enqueue(value): Insert an element at the rear

dequeue(): Remove an element from the front

peek(): View the front element without removing it

is_empty(): Check if the queue is emptyImplementation Details

Stack Implementation (Using List)

Uses Python's built-in list as an array.

push() appends an element to the end of the list.

pop() removes and returns the last element.

peek() returns the last element without removing it.

Queue Implementation (Using List)

Uses Python's built-in list as an array.

enqueue() appends an element to the end of the list.

dequeue() removes and returns the first element.

peek() returns the first element without removing it.

Limitations

The pop() and dequeue() operations have O(1) and O(n) complexity respectively due to Python's list behavior.

For a more efficient queue, consider using collections.deque.
